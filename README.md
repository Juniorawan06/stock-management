# stock-management-system

Started the project for learning and getting more experience about Core PHP.
Used starBootstrap and dev-dashboard to design the frontend. 
Merged the both dashboards to give a unique look to the frontend.
This is the first project in which Ajax.
The system is secure, no one of the users can't update or delete without knowing any one else.
This is also my first project where i used JQUERY.
Different roles are there for admin and user.
Only Admins are allowed to add, update, and delete staff.
